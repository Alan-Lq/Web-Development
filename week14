Pay attention!

This week we don't have any lab works. We changed the deadline for the project defense to week 16. So, the timetable for each group will be provided soon. 

Again, you have to:

Show a fully finished Django project with all requests
Angular projects must work with Django and implement all requests from our project requirements
